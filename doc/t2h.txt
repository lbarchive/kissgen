                                     HOOKS


The conversion process provides the following hooks:


- title <- basename of text file

    The default title is filtered by t2h_html_encode, the final output is 
    wrapped in <title>.

- after_title <- ''

- before_pre <- ''

- pre <- text

    The text is filtered by t2h_html_encode, the final output is wrapped in 
    <pre>.

- after_pre <- ''


"<-" denotes what initial input is.


                                    FILTERS


All filters operates on standard input/output.
